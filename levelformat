Level Storage Format
********************************
Level data files are gzipped text files, with the following format.

Line 1 is always:
ALGEBRAADVENTURELEVELFILE
to ensure that the parser doesn't try to load something that isn't a level

Line 2 is:
(length of level,height of level)
in pixels

Line 3 is the coordinates of the upper left pixel of the player at starts

Subsequent lines are the parameters of an object,
 followed by the upper left coordinate to draw them
 
The last line is the tuple of the center of the end circle
